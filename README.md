# Build Blockchain Insurance Application

This project showcases the use of blockchain in insurance domain for claim processing. In this application, we have four participants, namely insurance, police, repair shop and shop peer. Insurance peer is the insurance company providing the insurance for the products and it is responsible for processing the claims. Police peer is responsible for verifying the theft claims. Repair shop peer is responsible for repairs of the product while shop peer sells the products to consumer.

Audience level : Intermediate Developers

## Included Components
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Docker

## Application Workflow Diagram


* Generate Certificates for peers
* Build Docker images for network
* Start the insurance network

## Prerequisites
We find that Blockchain can be finicky when it comes to installing Node. We want to share this [StackOverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49744276/error-cannot-find-module-api-hyperledger-composer) - because many times the errors you see with Composer are derived in having installed either the wrong Node version or took an approach that is not supported by Composer: 

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview) - v1.13 or higher
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) - v1.8 or higher
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - v5.6.0 or higher
* [nvm]() - v8.11.3 (use to download and set what node version you are using)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - node v8.11.3 ** don't install in SUDO mode
* [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - v 2.9.x or higher
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - 2.7.x

## Steps

1. [Run the application](#1-run-the-application)

## 1. Run the application

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app.git
```

Login using your [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) credentials.
```bash
docker login
```

Run the build script to download and create docker images for the orderer, insurance-peer, police-peer, shop-peer, repairshop-peer, web application and certificate authorities for each peer. This will run for a few minutes.

For Mac user:
```bash
cd build-blockchain-insurance-app
./build_mac.sh
```

For Ubuntu user:
```bash
cd build-blockchain-insurance-app
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

You should see the following output on console:
```
Creating repairshop-ca ...
Creating insurance-ca ...
Creating shop-ca ...
Creating police-ca ...
Creating orderer0 ...
Creating repairshop-ca
Creating insurance-ca
Creating police-ca
Creating shop-ca
Creating orderer0 ... done
Creating insurance-peer ...
Creating insurance-peer ... done
Creating shop-peer ...
Creating shop-peer ... done
Creating repairshop-peer ...
Creating repairshop-peer ... done
Creating web ...
Creating police-peer ...
Creating web
Creating police-peer ... done
```

**Wait for few minutes for application to install and instantiate the chaincode on network**

Check the status of installation using command:
```bash
docker logs web
```
On completion, you should see the following output on console:
```
> blockchain-for-insurance@2.1.0 serve /app
> cross-env NODE_ENV=production&&node ./bin/server

/app/app/static/js

## Troubleshooting

* Run `clean.sh` to remove the docker images and containers for the insurance network.
```bash
./clean.sh
```
